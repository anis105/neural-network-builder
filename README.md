# Neural Network Configuration Builder

This project provides a web-based interface for creating and configuring neural network models. Users can upload a JSON configuration file, add or modify layers, and compute results based on the configured model. The application utilizes TensorFlow.js for model creation and computation directly in the browser.

## Features

- Upload a JSON file to load initial neural network configuration.
- Add new layers with specified parameters (e.g., number of input and output features for linear layers).
- Compute and download the results of the neural network computation.

## Usage

1. **Start the Application**: Ensure the application is running and accessible via a web browser.
2. **Upload Configuration**: Use the "Choose File" button to upload a neural network configuration JSON file.
3. **Add Layers (Optional)**: Click the "Add Layer" button to specify additional layers for the neural network.
4. **Compute Results**: Click the "Compute and Download Results" button to process the neural network and download the output.

## Sample Neural Network Configuration JSON

```json
{
  "layers": [
    {
      "type": "linear",
      "in_features": 784,
      "out_features": 128
    },
    {
      "type": "linear",
      "in_features": 128,
      "out_features": 64
    }
  ]
}
```

## Development

This project is built using React and Mantine for the frontend, with TensorFlow.js for neural network operations.

## License

This project is open-source and available under the MIT license.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
